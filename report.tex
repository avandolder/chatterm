    \section{Introduction}
    For my Computer Networks project, I decided to create a client-server chat
    application in Python.
    \section{Features of Application}
    ChatTerm is a fully functional terminal-based chat server and client, with
    commands inspired by the IRC protocol. The client uses a text-based user
    interface, while the server isn't interactive. Many clients can connect to a
    given server by its domain and port number, and can then communicate with
    each other. Servers provide a series of different channels that clients can
    join in order to chat about more specific topics, and clients can make new
    channels on-the-fly. Clients are free to set non-conflicting nick names for
    themselves, and request lists of current users connected to the server.
    Clients can also direct message any other client connected to the same
    server The client's text window can be cleared of current messages as well.
    \section{Tools and Techniques}
    ChatTerm relies primarily upon Python for its operation.
    More specifically, I made use of Python 3.6 and some of its libraries: sys,
    threading, typing, socket, and string, all of which come with Python by
    default. I also made use of Python's curses library, which only comes with
    Python on Linux and Mac OS X, so on Windows the `windows-curses` library
    must be installed as well. When writing the project, I mainly used Vim. In
    order to create the report, I used LaTex and the texlive package.
    \section{Implementation Details}
    ChatTerm is based around a server-client architecture, using the TCP
    protocol via the socket library to provide communication between the
    processes. The server is multi-threaded, spinning off a new thread to handle
    each new client that connects. The client is single-threaded, and uses
    curses in order to maintain a Text-User-Interface (TUI) that shows both the
    messages from the server as well as the users input at the same time.
    \section{Execution Instructions} 
    In order to run ChatTerm, you will need Python installed, and at it will
    need to be at least version 3.6. In order to run the client, you will also
    need the Curses library installed. If you are running Python on Linux or
    Mac, then Curses will be installed by default. However, on Windows, you will
    need to install the \emph{windows-curses} library. This can be installed
    with the following command:\\
    \textbf{python -m pip install windows-curses}\\
    Then, in order to launch the server, you will have to run the following
    command from the project directory:\\
    \textbf{python src/server.py domain portnumber}\\
    If you want to run a server instance that interacts with clients on the same
    machine, set \emph{domain} to localhost and \emph{portnumber} to a high
    number that is likely unused, such as 9999.\\
    In order to launch a client, run the following command:\\
    \textbf{python src/client.py}\\
    You can then enter the \emph{/help} command in order to get a list of the
    supported commands. Enter \emph{/server} followed by the domain and port
    number you gave the server instance in order to join your local server.

    documentation, especially:\\
